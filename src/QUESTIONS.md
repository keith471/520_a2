# QUESTIONS

## For class


## Just for me
- scoping rules? Don't see anything regarding scoping in the specs.
    - don't need to worry about this because we force all declarations to be global and the first thing in the file
- why does FIELD use a linked list and STATEMENT uses some sort of linked list but with a first/second structure?
    - i.e. why the difference? don't really understand why the first/second thing works. what is a statement sequence?

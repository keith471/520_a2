# TODOS

- add appropriate error handling to symbol table
    - then test!!!
- should probably add type to SYMBOL

- check if there are any additional things we need to support in the language



- symbol table probably only needs two columns: identifier and type, since we declare everything at once
- should use to ensure that variables aren't declared more than once

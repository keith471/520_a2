## Instructions
### In general
```
cd keith_strickling/src
make clean
make main
```
The above produces the executable `out` in the src folder. Then, from **anywhere**, you can run the executable with
`<path_to_out> <path_to_min_file> <path_to_src_folder>`
which will write all output files to `<path_to_src_folder/output/`

### If using test.sh
cd into keith_strickling
Run with `./test.sh`
The output files will be written to `./src/output/`

The work here is based off of the joos compiler source code and Hanfeng's reference compiler.
